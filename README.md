Whether you're a beginner or looking to revisit concepts, you’ll find a variety of small projects and code examples here that cover everything from the basics to some advanced features.

## What’s inside?

- Hands-on practice with **MVC architecture**, routing, middleware, and dependency injection
- Real-world examples of **building APIs**, working with **views**, and managing data with CRUD operations

- Clean, organized code that you can explore, run, and learn from at your own pace
